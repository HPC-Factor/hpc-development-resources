## Visual Basic

## Java

There are numerous Java runtimes for Windows CE. Sun created PortableJava, a somewhat limited runtime which was compatible with Java SE 1.2. Other companies created JREs which won;t be covered here since they were mostly commercial and lack documentation.
Another notable product was Microsoft Visual J++, which was part of the embedded Visual Toolkit until support was dropped in embedded Visual Tools 6.0, meaning it was not possible to use J++ for creating Windows CE 3.0 apps, at least not for ARM processors.
